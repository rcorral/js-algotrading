# Algo trading libraries

I've decided to open source some of the libraries that I've written. I'll be adding more of them as I have time.

I've written most if not everything using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

# Testing

```
npm test
```

# LICENSE

All of this code is under the MIT License.

Pull requests are welcome!
